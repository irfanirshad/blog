You like computers? You like software? You're probably already secretly married to Bash then

## What's bash? Where do I even start?

Bash is a shell program.

A shell program is typically an executable binary that takes commands that you type and  translates those commands into system calls to the Operating System API.

<a href="https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/basics" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a quick read-up on its basics incase you're not already familiar with bash.

Note that bash is not the only kind of shell. There are other shells out there as well.
This diagram helps give a picture of the history of bash:

Just dropping <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ" target="_blank">this FAQ link</a> here for those questions I can't answer because I have disabled comments functionality on this site lol. However the wiki/FAQ should more than makeup for my failings.

Back to the topic, in this post, we are going to use [Figwheel Main](https://figwheel.org/), a brand new upgraded version of lein-figwheel, to build a chrome extension.
I have used it in [GitHub Colorful Contributions](https://github.com/g1eny0ung/github-colorful-contributions-graph) to replace lein-figwheel.
There will be some differences from regular web development that require our special attention. But don't worry, I will point out them later.

Let's start.

## Before starting1

There will be some differences from regular web development that require our special attention. But don't worry, I will point out them later.


## Setup

Assuming you have [lein](https://leiningen.org/) installed, then open <https://rigsomelight.com/figwheel-main-template/> and copy the `new` command to your shell:

```bash
lein new figwheel-main hello-world.core -- --reagent
```

> Note: for a simple setup, we won't use `+npm-bundle` in the options but use cljsjs packages.

This command will create a dir named `hello-world.core` and add a minimal [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/) application into it.

Then we can run:

```bash
lein fig:build
```

to bootstrap the dev environment. After build, a new tab will be opened automatically and the repl will also be launched.

We can test it by run below in repl:

```clj
(js/alert "Am I connected?")
```

If you see an alert opened, then our preparations are complete.

## Extension manifest

To develop a chrome extension, we need to create a `manifest.json` in the `resources/public` dir:

```bash
touch resources/public/manifest.json
```

You can view [Manifest file format](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/manifest/#manifest_version) for more details. This time we will fill the content below:

```json
{
  "name": "Hello World",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "browser_action": {
    "default_popup": "index.html"
  }
}
```

Then we can go to the next step.

## Load unpacked

Now we can put it into extensions, open `chrome://extensions` and click **Load unpacked** to select `resources/public` folder:

![Load unpacked](/img/build-a-chrome-extension-with-figwheel-main/load-unpacked.png)

Everything looks normal, but when you click the extension icon in the extensions bar, some errors will occur:

![Errors](/img/build-a-chrome-extension-with-figwheel-main/errors.png)

This is the first point we need to pay attention to: [Chrome Apps Content Security Policy](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/apps/contentSecurityPolicy/).

Since we are in a development environment, Figwheel Main will insert some inline scripts (relate to its own functionality) into the document. You can view the `dev-main.js`:

```js
if (typeof goog == 'undefined') document.write('<script src="/cljs-out/dev/goog/base.js"></script>')
document.write('<script src="/cljs-out/dev/goog/deps.js"></script>')
document.write('<script src="/cljs-out/dev/cljs_deps.js"></script>')
document.write(
  '<script>if (typeof goog == "undefined") console.warn("ClojureScript could not load :main, did you forget to specify :asset-path?");</script>'
)
document.write('<script>goog.require("figwheel.core");</script>')
document.write('<script>goog.require("figwheel.main");</script>')
document.write('<script>goog.require("figwheel.repl.preload");</script>')
document.write('<script>goog.require("devtools.preload");</script>')
document.write('<script>goog.require("figwheel.main.system_exit");</script>')
document.write('<script>goog.require("figwheel.main.css_reload");</script>')
document.write('<script>goog.require("process.env");</script>')
document.write('<script>goog.require("hello_world.core");</script>')
```

This violates this rule:

> You can't use inline scripting in your Chrome App pages. The restriction bans both \<script\> blocks and event handlers (\<button onclick="..."\>).

Refer to the errors above, to solve this problem, we need to set `content_security_policy` field in the `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "content_security_policy": "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'sha256-xxx' 'sha256-xxx' 'sha256-xxx'; object-src 'self'"
}
```

The errors contain all `sha256-xxx` which need to be filled in the policy field. This is a little bit cumbersome. You may think why we can't use the `unsafe-inline`?
Because chrome ignores this keyword especially, even the errors tell you can ðŸ˜¢.

After finishing this, edit the code and you will see that your code has completed the hot reload ðŸ˜Ž.

## Production

After you finish your application, you still need to do something before bundle it.

By developing the chrome extension, you need to use `chrome` API to do somethings, like save and sync the user storage, etc. We need to tell the closure compiler `chrome` is the [externs](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/externs-and-exports) we used.

There are two files we need to download: <https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/blob/master/contrib/externs/chrome.js> and <https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/blob/master/contrib/externs/chrome_extensions.js>.

Put them into `externs` folder and edit `dev.cljs.edn` like below content:

```clj
{:main hello-world.core
 :externs ["externs/chrome.js" "externs/chrome_extensions.js"]}
```

Then run:

```bash
lein fig:min
```

to build the production code.

## Conclusion

These are all steps to build a chrome extension with Figwheel Main.

If you are looking for a real-world example as a reference, the [GitHub Colorful Contributions](https://github.com/g1eny0ung/github-colorful-contributions-graph) is what you want.

Thanks for reading. Happy coding with Figwheel Main!
