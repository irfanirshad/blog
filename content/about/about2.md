**Electronics ~ Software = Consumer Electronics**

<!--more-->
I work as a software engineer at Infor in the Core DataMesh Platform Team. 

The platform handles complex data pipelines, supporting over 300 features for efficient ETL processes, data integration and real-time analytics. My work primarily focuses on building scalable, high-performance data workflows.

In my personal life, I'm into all kinds of consumer electronic products which have little or a lot of software on them. So naturally, I find myself spending time with these gadgets, be it a soldering iron or reverse engineering with Ida. 

As of late, I find myself getting better with Machine learning techniques and applying it to the market.

**Professional background details:**
<br/>
I hold B.Tech and M.Tech degrees in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad (IIIT-A), India.


I am eager to advance my career in the IT sector with a focus on becoming a Software Architect. I aim to design and build highly scalable, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems that can handle large loads efficiently. I am looking to join an innovative organization where I can leverage my experience in data engineering and system design to tackle complex challenges, while continually expanding my knowledge and honing my expertise in modern software architecture.
