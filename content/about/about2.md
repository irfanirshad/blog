**Electronics ~ Software = Consumer Electronics**

<!--more-->
I am a software engineer working in a commercial real estate firm in Chennai. 

I'm into all kinds of consumer electronic products which have little or a lot of software on them. So naturally, I spend most of my time levelling myself in this realm of hardware + software combination.

**Professional background details:**
<br/>
I've completed my B.Tech and M.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, India.

I'm looking to explore career options in IT sector and be a part of a progressive organization that gives a scope to enhance my knowledge and utilizing my skills towards the growth of the organization.
